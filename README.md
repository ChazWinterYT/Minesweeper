# Minesweeper
Shoddy attempt to recreate Minesweeper in JavaFX.

## Why?!
As of the start of this project, I am a student in Amazon Technical Academy. I want to get some practical coding experience beyond what they are teaching me in the program.
One way to do that is to just make programs. So here we are. A Minesweeper (Chazsweeper!) clone.

## How to play
For now, the only way to play it is to clone the repo and run start() (or main) in com.chazwinter.minesweeper.MinesweeperApplication. <br>
./gradlew run in the terminal works too.<br>
I tried for HOURS to make an exe and dmg file. But every time I fixed one issue, a new one popped up. I finally got fed up and stopped trying.<br>
Maybe someone smarter than me can tell me what I'm doing wrong, or clone the repo and make the executables for me.<br>
I gave up when javac gave the error "JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application."<br>
Those components are there. I don't know why it's saying they're not. I even tried rewriting everything in Java 8 (which has JavaFX built in). <br>
No idea what the issue is, and I've given up trying to figure it out.

## Project status
I am in the process of migrating this code to a Vaadin project using Spring Boot. Therefore, I will no longer be updating this repo while I learn the process of turning this into a web application. I should have done it that way in the first place, but I'm new to this and didn't know any better.

## Want to help?
Since I am not going to update this repo, any help would be with the migration process. I will provide a new repo link once that process is far enough along.
