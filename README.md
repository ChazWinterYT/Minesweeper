# Minesweeper
Shoddy attempt to recreate Minesweeper in JavaFX.

## Why?!
As of the start of this project, I am a student in Amazon Technical Academy. I want to get some practical coding experience beyond what they are teaching me in the program.
One way to do that is to just make programs. So here we are. A Minesweeper (Chazsweeper!) clone.

## How to play
For now, the only way to play it is to clone the repo and run start() (or main) in com.chazwinter.minesweeper.MinesweeperApplication. 
./gradlew run in the terminal works too.
I tried for HOURS to make an exe and dmg file. But every time I fixed one issue, a new one popped up. I finally got fed up and stopped trying.
Maybe someone smarter than me can tell me what I'm doing wrong, or clone the repo and make the executables for me.
I gave up when javac gave the error "JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application."
Those components are there. I don't know why it's saying they're not. I even tried rewriting everything in Java 8 (which has JavaFX built in). 
No idea what the issue is, and I've given up trying to figure it out.

## Project status
The app works as intended (as far as I know!). I will make edits based on any code review feedback, but I don't think any additional functionality is needed. 

## Want to help?
I need practice with collaborating on code and handling pull requests anyway, so I don't mind getting help (provided you don't do all the work for me).
I'm not sure how that process works, so maybe you can help with that too (pull request rules/procedures, for example).
